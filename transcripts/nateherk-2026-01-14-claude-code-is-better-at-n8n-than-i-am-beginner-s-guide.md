## Transcript

All right, so I just brain dumped a manual process into chatbt and it spit this out for me. And now I'm going to come into Claude code and just say, "Hey Claude, build me this end workflow. Then I'm just going to paste in that information and shoot that off and I'll check in with you guys when we get that

workflow back." Okay, so that took about 3 minutes and you can see now that the workflow has finished. So let me open up this link. Wow. I mean, for me to be able to just brain dump into Cloud Code and have it spit this out. Now all I have to do is connect my credentials and I should be good to go. And just a real

quick breakdown what actually happened here. You can see that it's not perfect. It creates a to-do list. It starts to slowly go through each of its tasks and check them off as done. It's searching through documentation to figure out what nodes to use and how to set them up. And the cool thing about Cloud Code is when

it runs into issues, it literally figures out why it went wrong and then it fixes it. Right here, you can see I see there are some issues with the code node parameters and Slack node configuration. Let me fix these by updating the workflow. It happened two more times. I see the Slack node

configuration uses this. Let me fix it. I see the code node needs this. Let me fix it. And that's the power of using these super strong models like Opus 4.5 in cloud code paired with MCP servers and tools and skills. So I'm going to show you exactly how we set this up today. And trust me, I know it might

look a little intimidating, but I'm going to make it super super simple. So let's get into it. All right, so you guys know that my job is to make complicated and intimidating things as simple as possible. So even if you're not super interested in this specific use case of cloud code building Nin

workflows, I still would highly recommend that you watch this video. I really think learning cloud code is the future of AI automation. I've been all in on Naden, but lately I've been going all in on cloud code and I'm going to be bringing a lot more of this type of content to my channel. And so I think if

you take the next hour and just follow along with this video and do the steps that I'm showing in this tutorial, it will be an amazing investment of your time because inevitably later when you realize you need to get into Cloud Code, it's going to make it so much easier because we're going to break everything

down today super simply. So the first thing you're going to want to do is go to your browser and download Visual Studio Code, which you can just go to a browser and type it in and then it will look like this. and you'll just go ahead and download that for your system. Visual Studio Code is just an interface

that's going to let us connect and use Cloud Code through an extension. And the reason why I chose VS Code is because it's just the cleanest and it looks the least cody in my opinion because you could do it on something like Cursor or of course you could just access Cloud Code in your terminal like this. But I

don't want to be looking at this at all and I know that 80% or more of you guys don't want to be looking at this either. So we're going to do it in VS Code and it's going to be pretty simple and I'll show you guys how. All right. All right. So, once we're in here, you're going to go over to the lefth hand side and

you're going to click on extensions. Once you get here, you're going to type in cloud code and it should pop up right there. And you'll click on cloud code and then just go ahead and install it. When you install this, it should automatically pop up and just have you sign into your Anthropic Cloud account,

which would be the same as if you went to Google Chrome and typed in Claude and you were talking to Claude right there. It'll have you log over there so that you can use your plan in VS Code with the extension. Now, from here, you're going to go over to the lefth hand side and click on explorer. And this just

basically means that we have to open up a folder to work inside of for this specific project. And so what I did in my documents folder, I made a folder called aentic workflows where I'm just going to have a bunch of different projects for cloud code. And I'm going to open up this one called naden builder

which has nothing in it. So it's a fresh project. And I'm going to select it. And what you can see here is now on the lefth hand side we have this project which is n builder. And different files will pop up as we start making things in here. And then on the right hand side, we've got the actual interface where

we're going to talk to Claude. And the way that you do that is on the top right, you'll see this little extension button. And you can open up Claude Code. Close out of this. And now we have Claude Code ready to go working in this project for us. And this looks very similar to when you would use like a

chat GBT or Claude on the web. So the first thing you want to think about doing in a project is actually telling Claude Code what you want to do in this project. So, giving it a bit of a system prompt as far as this is the environment you're in and this is what we're going to do together. You can even see right

here it says, "Tired of repeating yourself? Tell Claude to remember what you've told it using claude.md." So, what we're going to do is come over to our explorer. I'm going to click on new file and I'm going to type in claude.md. And this just creates a markdown file for us that is essentially think of it

as the system prompt for this project. So, when we're in the file, we can actually look at it. We could also close out of it. And if we wanted to, we could open it back up again. But that's just like the interface that we're working in here. Now, the first thing that I actually want to do is I want to put in

that system prompt. And what we're going to do is use Claude to build that system prompt. One thing that I want you guys to take note of is down here we've got different modes. So, right now we're on bypass permissions, which just means that Claude doesn't have to ask us anything. It can just go ahead and take

action and execute things, which is really good to be in later when we want it to actually run for us. But right now, what I want to do is go to um plan mode. You can see there's also ask before edits, there's edit automatically. But what we're going to do pretty much every time before we

actually say, "Okay, go ahead and do that for me." Is we're going to work on plan mode. And if you're cycling through right now and you don't see the bypass permissions, the reason why is because you're going to have to go to your settings, which is in here, you're going to go ahead and type in clawed code. And

then when you get there, you should see allow dangerously skip permissions. And you have to turn that on if you want to allow bypass permissions mode. Now, it seems dangerous, but it's really not because you are still in control and you can watch it and once you set up different like prompts and different,

you know, instructions, it will pretty much work inside that environment. But that's just how you get that setting. So, I'm just going to explain to Claude what I want to do and then it's going to help me plan out to create that claw.md system prompt. So, I'm just going to say, "Hey, Claude, I need you to help me

create the cloud.MD file for this project." Basically, what I've set up this project for is just to help me create workflows in NAN using you. So, I'm going to give you access to a few different tools. One of them will be the NAN MCP server and one of them will be Nadn skills and you'll use those in

combination with my request to help build workflows in my NAND instance that are high quality. So the end MCP server and the end skills. Right after we set up this file, I'll show you guys what those are and explain how those are going to work together with us. But right now,

let's just basically take a look at what's going on. So when you send off a request to Claude in this environment, it's going to start doing some stuff. But the cool thing about this is if you just play around with it and talk to it, it will basically walk you through what's going on in its mind. So you can

see it started off by saying, I'll help you create the claw.md file for this NN workflow builder project. Let me first explore what's already in here. And you can see on this left-h hand side in our file explorer, there's nothing in here already. So, it's going to search through it for a bit and then it's going

to come back and give us some more information. And I know that cloud code might seem intimidating, but really it's just as simple as if you can talk to a developer or if you can talk to a brainstorm partner, you can use cloud code. The key is not being able to know how to read code and understand what

it's doing. The key is can you clearly communicate what you want? Because if you can communicate the end goal, claude will help you get there. Because what it does is it asks you questions like, "Hey, did you mean this or this?" or "Do you want this or this?" And because Opus models and sonnet models are so good,

they'll help you do pretty much anything you want. And if you ever get confused, you just say, "Hey, that doesn't make sense. Can you explain that to me?" Or, "Why'd you do that?" And it really, really helps you get things done fast. So now it's asking us some questions already. So it says, "What ended MCP

server tools will be available?" And I will say, I will share those details. It asks about the skills and I will once again provide those details. And then for the end setup, it asks what our setup is. And I'm just going to say that I'm using Enident Cloud and submit those answers, which once again, all of this

information is going to help it create its system prompt so that everything works better in the future. Okay, cool. So, it says, "Awesome. You're using Eniden Cloud and you will provide the details for the NIDAN MCP server and the NIDAN skills." And so, now that it's asking for that information, I'm just

going to go ahead and open up those GitHub repositories and show you guys what they are and what they do. And then we're going to just give Claude the URL so it can search, read, research, and just figure out for itself. But of course, before we do that, you know, I have to pull up a whiteboard. So what

we're looking at is basically at a high level, what we're actually building today in this Nadm project. So we have us over here on the lefth hand side, and what we're doing is we're talking to cloud code. And ultimately what we want cloud code to do is talk to our nen to build workflows for us. Now cloud code

by itself is smart and it knows JSON but it doesn't yet understand nodes and NN expression syntax and configuration and parameters. So what we need to do is give it access to different tools to do so. So the first one of those is NN MCP server which is this NN MCP server right here. It's on GitHub. I'll leave a link

to this down in the description. And also shout out to this guy. I'm not even going to try to pronounce his name because he built both this MCP and he also built the skills which we'll show you in a second. So in this repo you can actually read about what this is and what it does but I'm actually just going

to go to the website that he built for it which basically says to connect your AI to NN and let it build, deploy and debug workflows for you. So it makes it super easy. Now how does it actually do that? Well, it has complete node coverage. So all of the 1100 nodes with 99% property accuracy. So, parameters,

options, and all that kind of stuff perfectly documented. It's got over 2,700 workflow templates, so it can look through those, pull different elements from them, and get some inspiration, all these other benefits, of course, and the ability to create, update, activate, and manage your NN workflows. So, really

simply, all I'm going to do is copy the URL from this GitHub repo, go into VS Code, and first of all, just say here is the NN MCP server, and link that in there. And then let's go back into Chrome and let me talk about the NN skills which once again is a GitHub repo. And basically what it says here is

NN skill set for cloud code to build flawless endm workflows. So basically what this is is it teaches the AI model. So it'll teach claude code how to use this. And so if you've never heard of like a claude skill, basically just think of them like system instructions. And the benefit here is that claude only

reads through them when it needs to. So if you think about this master cloud code agent having all of this context of all the nodes and all of the different ways to use them, every time you talk to it, it would use so many tokens to read through all that. And so essentially these are tools because it knows I have

access to this stuff, but I'm only going to call it when I know that I need it. And so it basically uses the skills, it uses the MCP server, and then it's able to actually build really nice workflows in NN. And so in the NN skills repo, if you scroll down, which you guys can read about, here are the seven skills that it

gets access to. It knows about expression syntax which is really important. It knows how to use that MCP server that we just looked at. It knows workflow patterns. It knows how to validate them. It knows how the nodes are configured. And then it also knows how to code both in JavaScript and

Python. So now when we give our cloud code access to these two things, it basically just becomes supercharged in building NN workflows. So, I'm going to go ahead and copy the URL to the NIN skills. Open up our cloud code and then just say here are the Nadn skills.

You can go ahead and research them so that you can make the cloud.md file better. So, go ahead and shoot that off and it will continue to build out a plan for our system prompt for this project. You can see what it's doing right now is researching those and it's using a web fetch for those URLs just like we kind

of wanted it to do. Okay, so here's the plan that it came up with. It has an overview, a research summary, it has the skills, the structure, and all this kind of stuff. You could obviously go ahead and read through all of that, and then you could tell it to keep planning. But in this case, let's just go ahead and

auto accept this plan so that it will update that claude file for us. Okay, so it finished up that claude.md file and it goes over environment, MCP tools, skills, workflow building, safety rules, all this kind of stuff. So if I actually click into this file, we should now see that we have a pretty nice breakdown of

what we actually want to do in this project. So you can see for the workflow building, we have to understand requirements. We search templates, we research nodes, we build, we validate, and then we deploy. And so just giving our project a lot more structure as far as like what files it will have, what

the end goal is, it just makes the whole thing better. because otherwise if we didn't have a claw.md file, we would just start creating files willy-nilly and then claude itself would have no idea how to look through those and what it's trying to do. Okay, but the next step now is we need to actually go ahead

and install those two things, the MCP server and the skills. So, what I'm going to do is we're going to open up the slash, which has a bunch of different slash commands. That's how you can change the thinking model. You can do different plugins and things like that. What I'm going to do is slash

clear, which just lets us clear the conversation. And now we get to start fresh. So in the GitHub repo for both of these things, if you keep scrolling down, it'll basically go over how to install these things. And you've got these different like mcp.json files that you could do in order to install this

stuff. Same thing if we go to the skills and you can see if I scroll down, it shows installation. But what's so much easier is what we did earlier where we say, "Hey Claude, here are the two GitHub repos we want to get in our project. Just go ahead and install them." So I'm on bypass permissions mode

so I don't have to say yes anything. And I told it to install the server, install the skills, and I also said make sure they are accessible by cloud code in this project so that we can build flawless end workflows. And I'm going to let this run and then I'll check in with you guys when we get some sort of

response back. Now the one thing about bypass permissions is it still won't bypass permissions if it doesn't have enough information which is great because in this case if you remember the end MCP server is supposed to also be able to create manage and update workflows in your instance and I didn't

give it my instance information. So here it says do you have a cloud instance that you want to connect for workflow management? If yes I need the URL and API key. So I'm going to say yes I have ended in cloud and submit that. And then it's probably going to come back and say okay cool can you give me that

information? So let me just show you real quick how we can get that. And right on Q would it ask for both of those. So I'm just going to say I'll provide them. So let me go over to NN and let's actually get that information. So I'm in my NN cloud instance and first of all let's get the URL. So up up top

I'm just going to grab everything before the slashhome which is you know it should end incloud if you're on the cloud and I'll come back in here and I'll say I have both of these credentials ready. So it's actually just prompting us for them. So enter your end API URL. So, I'm just

going to go ahead and paste that in there as you can see. And now we're going to head back into editen and I'm going to go to my settings. I'm going to go to edit API. I'm going to create a new one. Call this one cloud code demo and copy that API key right there. And now, right on Q again, it's asking us

for the key. I'll say other. I'll paste it in right there. And then we will go ahead and submit those answers. So now it should be able to create the MCB configuration like we see right here. And then it's also going to clone those NN skills for us. You can see there's the to-do list. So, it did the end MCP

server. Now, it's installing the skills, which you can see just got put in right there. So, right here we have the MCP JSON file with our information. We have the NDN skills which are being added in which if I click under here, we should see now we have those seven skills that it talked about in the repo. And so

hopefully Claude will be able to look at these two things to help us actually build out our workflows after this is done. Okay, so I know we're moving a little fast, but let's just do a quick recap. left-hand side we're operating inside a project. This is a file in your computer. So I was in my documents in a

folder called agentic workflows in a fresh folder called nadident builder. What we see here are we have different files that we've created in this project. So we've got claw.md which is kind of like the system prompt. It runs through what this project is actually built for. We have connected our MCP

server which is the mcp.json right here which is the nin mcp and we've added those seven nen skills as you can see here. expression syntax tools expert blah blah blah and those can be found in here under skills which is what we connected from the GitHub repo and in the middle what we're looking at is

talking to Claude itself and as we're talking to it basically makes to-do lists it makes plans and it tells us what it's thinking so hopefully by now we're not too intimidated so what it's telling us now is to restart cloud code in order to actually load those servers and skills after restarted just test by

asking can you search for the web hook node using MCP So, let me just actually copy this right there. And then it says the Naden skills folder was cloned for reference. So, they basically just cloned it from the GitHub repo, which is why we see so much more stuff in here than just the actual seven skills

itself. And it tells us that we can delete it if we don't need it since the skills are installed globally. So, right now, I'm not going to worry about deleting that. But if we wanted to clean some stuff up, we could obviously have Claude walk us through how to delete just those things that we don't need.

So, I'm going to go ahead and close out of this conversation, exit out of VS Code, and as we open it back up, we are already still in our folder. If we weren't in this one, we would just go to file and we would open folder and hop back into it. But now, we're going to open up Cloud once again. And I am just

going to say, hey, just wanted to check that you were able to successfully install and use the Nitn MCP and NIN skills. And then I'm going to paste in that one test thing that it asked us to do, which was, can you search for the web hook node using the NN MCP server? So it says, I'll test the NN MCP

connection by searching for the node. You can see right here that it's actually using it. It's calling the search nodes function. And it says, yep, I was able to find 13 results for web hook. Also found Facebook ads, WhatsApp, Slack, blah blah blah. So it sounds like we're all successfully ready to go with

building end workflows. So, remember how I said that if you are getting confused or if you don't understand how something's working, you just ask. Well, here's an example of me just checking, are you also able to create workflows in my instance, it verified with the MCP server and it said, yep, here's

information about your instance. Here's what I can do. And then I said, do you also have the seven edit and skills that we need to build workflows and it went ahead and it looked through everything and it made sure we did have them. And it does in fact have them. So, now it says ready to build some workflows

whenever you are. So, I'm going to go ahead and do slash clear. We're going to clear the conversation and let's prompt it with a workflow that we want to build. Okay, so remember earlier we talked about the different modes. What I always want to do when I'm first starting off with some sort of plan is

obviously to go in plan mode so we can make sure we have a really nice prompt before we go ahead and let Claude code loose. So I'm in plan mode and I'm going to start to explain a workflow that I want. Hey Claude, I'd love to build a workflow where we have an AI agent and I want you to build this workflow in my

end instance. I want this AI agent to go off every morning at 7 a.m. and I want it to do research for me to help me find out information for my business. I have an AI automation agency. So, I want to make sure that every morning I'm getting insights as far as any AI developments or um specifically AI automation related

developments for um voice agents because that's the niche of my agency. Once it has that information, after it's done research, I want it to create an HTML styled newsletter for me and send it to my email through Gmail. And I want two separate AI agents. I want the first one that does research to use open router

and to use chatbt 5. And I want the second agent that writes the email and stylizes it in HTML to use open router, but I want it to use anthropic sonnet 4.5. Okay, so that is our request. We are going to shoot that off in plan mode and now it's going to come back ask us some

questions maybe and build out a plan and then we'll be able to go ahead and approve that. And so this is exactly what we wanted. What it's doing is it is creating a task. It's exploring through the MCP servers to search for different nodes and then it's going to build us an implementation plan. So I'll check in

with you guys when that plan is all ready. All right. So it's a little bit darker but it says I have a good understanding of the requirements. Let me ask a few clarification questions. The first one is which email address should the newsletter be sent to? I'm just going to go ahead and type in

nate@acample.com just to shoot that off. We've got the search tool. Which web search tool do you want to use? Okay, we've got SER API, GINA, http. I'm going to go ahead and say other. And I actually want to use perplexity. And then for time zone, it says, "What time zone do you want to

send from?" And I'm just going to go ahead and say Eastern time, which I'm not even in Eastern time, but just to make it easier, shoot off those questions. Okay, so we've got a pretty comprehensive plan here. As you can see, it is our AI research newsletter workflow plan. It's got some

architecture, so the different nodes, the schedule trigger, all this kind of stuff. The configuration details of each of these. Obviously, we could read through all of this and make some changes if we want. What I'm going to do is we're just going to go ahead and auto accept this to see how well it did on

its own, and we will see what happens next. Oh, wait. Actually, I'm going to stop this real quick because what I noticed is that it said what I'm creating is a single workflow file in JSON. But actually what we want to do is have it created in our edit instance. So I'm just going to go ahead and change

this to bypass permissions and I'm going to say that plan looks great. I want you to just go ahead and create that in my edit instance and just give me a link so that I can go look at it. All right. So there we go. You can see it had a to-do list with three items. One was to create the workflow, one was to validate it,

and then one was to report completion. And so we have the link and then we have some next steps as far as connecting your credentials, making it active, things like that. So let's click into the link. Okay, we can see we've got the workflow right here with our schedule trigger,

our research agent, our newsletter writer, and our newsletter Gmail tool. So, let me real quick just connect all these credentials. Okay, now that that's set up, we're going to go ahead and run this. So, we're pretending that this went off at 7:00 a.m. Eastern time. We can see that it's using its Perplexity

tool, its open router, and let me just also make sure this one was supposed to be GBT 5, which this one's 4.1, so it messed up a little bit there. It filled in tokens and temperature, which is kind of funny. This one was supposed to be set 4.5 and it was sonnet 4. So it messed up a little bit on that actual

configuration, but that's not a huge deal. You can see that it's searching perplexity. It's actually done three searches already. So if I click into the research agent, we can see that we have a user message, which is to research the latest developments. Actually, let me just make this full screen. Research the

latest developments in AI automation and voice agent technology from the past week. Focus on these five things. Search for these four things and then compile your findings. It also says to source citations, which is nice. And then if we go into the actual system message, let's see what we've got in

here. You are an AI research analyst specializing in AI automation and voice agent technology. Your role is to gather relevant information, be thorough, be concise, prioritize actionable insights that would help an agency owner stay ahead of industry trends. So, it's really good that it's making these

prompts pretty nice for us. Once this research finishes up, we will go over to the newsletter writer. So, let's take a look at this prompt. Okay, cool. So, the user message was already an expression because it knows that it needs all of the research from the previous agent. And we can see that we've got it coming

through right here. And then it says, "Transform the above research findings into a professional HTML newsletter. Follow the styling guide in your system prompt." Okay, so we'll take a look at that styling guide in a sec. What we can see here is the we get the actual results of the research from the

previous agent. So, we've got breaking news in AI. We've got voice agent and conversational developments, AI automation tools and platforms, industry trends affecting AI agencies, and new voice AI products, and then some headlines and action for agency owners. Super cool.

And then real quick, just to take a look at the actual system message, it basically gives us a HTML styling guide and some newsletter structure, which is great. So, it looks like that all finished up and it got sent to the correct email, I hope, which was nate@ample.com.

It comes through as AI automation daily brief with the date and it's formatted which is nice. And then we have the actual message and it even turned off the append edit an attribution which I don't think I explicitly told it to do. So that's pretty cool. But let me go to the email and let's take a look. Okay.

Wow. Look at this. We've got our AI automation daily brief for January 14th. It's obviously stylized in HTML. We've got an executive summary with the Aentic AI market exploding. We've got top stories. So, we've got some headlines like the agentic AI market is set for growth, enterprise agent ops, hardware

breakthrough. We've got some voice agent focus because that's what I told it was my niche. So, we've got emotionally intelligent agents, global support, new voice AI integrations, some quick hits, some action items for agency owners. And then at the bottom, we've got a bunch of sources, which is pretty cool as well.

So, obviously, this was our oneshot prompt for this workflow. If we wanted to iterate upon this, we could go ahead and come back into VS Code with our cloud code and say, "Hey, this workflow is great. Can you make these changes to the prompt or could you switch out some things here?" And it would actually be

able to take that instance, change it, and then we'd see those changes reflected in our end cloud. This workflow obviously wouldn't take me, you know, more any more than an hour if I was building it myself in Naden, but hopefully you can see if you're a beginner and you need to help brainstorm

through some things, cloud code's going to help you out a ton. And also, if you think about as you scale up to some more complex use cases where maybe you need to think about how you're going to handle the data and things like that, using cloud code and plan mode is really, really going to help you out

because it's going to ask you a lot of questions that you may not have thought of yourself when you're building out your workflow. And something else that I talk a lot about in my plus community is the importance of wireframing things out, as you guys could tell earlier when I did this. And so I imagine if you

wireframed out a workflow and you gave that screenshot to a cloud project like this, a cloud code project like this, it would be able to do a lot better too because it already knows kind of like the general architecture and structure that you're thinking of for your NN workflow. Like I said, that's something

I talk a lot about in my plus community with full courses on NN and building agencies and stuff like that. So if you're interested, the link for that will be down in the description. So let's just do a quick recap of what we actually talked about today. We got familiar with VS code and cloud code and

we understand that the lefth hand side is our project where we have different files and we have basically a system prompt that explains what this project is going to do. We've got the middle section where we actually talk to either we look at our files or we talk to cloud code itself. We have different modes to

talk to cloud code like bypass permissions, ask before edits, edit automatically or plan mode which is really important when you're actually trying to figure out what you want to do. And then we talked about how you can give it access to MCP servers, skills, and rather than trying to figure out how

to configure it yourself, just make cloud code do the research. And something funny about cloud code is sometimes it'll do the research and say, "Hey, you know, I can do this for you." Or you could just install it yourself. And a lot of times you just have to say, "No, you do it." Like, "I don't want to

do anything. I just want you to do everything for me." And it will do it all for you. So key lesson, don't be intimidated by cloud code. I'm going to have a lot more content around this coming. So, please let me know what type of use cases you guys want to see when it comes to automating things with cloud

code. The thing you need to remember is all that matters is can you communicate clearly what you want as if you were talking to a human developer or a human project manager or even just a regular human. If you can communicate it clearly and if you can ask questions when you're confused, you will be fine with cloud

code. And once again, the interface is going to get better, the models are going to get better. So the earlier you jump on this, the easier it's going to be when inevitably every person in the world starts using cloud code. Okay, one final thing that I wanted to just make sure you guys were aware of is it has

its limits. So obviously I was trying to get to that line and see how far I could push it and I was able to build some really complicated workflows and some cool agents, but I tried building one where it was going to be like 60 nodes. And what ended up happening is it basically like throttled the API and it

just like became unresponsive. And this was like over an hour ago. And my N&N cloud is still down. And so the thing is here, NAN's cloud server is what's down specifically for my domain here. But if I open up a different cloud instance that I own from NN, that one's working.

So there's an error going on here. You can see it's 522. And I'm basically, I think, going to have to reach out to them and have them like re reboot the server or something like that. If you were doing this on self-hosted, you'd be able to reboot it yourself and you'd be good to go. But this is something I

wanted to at least let you guys be aware of is that if you do make some massive crazy requests and it's timing out and then it's trying again and it's just like, you know, just trying to do way too much. This may happen. So, um I just felt like I was obligated to at least tell you guys that. So, anyways, and if

it helps you guys out, I will drop this claw.md file, which keep in mind I oneshotted with plan mode, but I will drop this in my free school community if you want to grab that for free. The link for that is down in the description. It will look like this. All you have to do is get in here and I'll have a post

associated with this video and like let's pretend it's this post. You would just see right here I would attach a JSON file or a doc with that exact cloud.md file in there so that you guys could just paste that over to your cloud code if you want to play around with this use case. But anyways, that is

going to do it for today. So if you enjoyed the video or if you learned something new, please give it a like. It definitely helps me out a ton. And as always, I appreciate you guys making it to the end of the video. So I will see you on the next one. Thanks so much, guys.
