The pitch for multi- aent AI systems is seductive, but we're learning the wrong lessons about how to build them. Look, I get the pitch. What if you had 10 or 100 AI agents working on a task instead of just one? Imagine how much more productive you could be. And we do see cases where that's true. It's not a

hypothetical. Cursor is running hundreds of agents on tasks at a time. Steve Yaggi's Gas Town orchestrates 20 to 30 agents simultaneously on sustained development work, and he's just one engineer. The technology does work, but what nobody is talking about is that the systems that scale don't often look like

what the frameworks recommend. So industry consensus often compares agents to human teams. They share context. They coordinate dynamically. They operate continuously. You see this even in cases like the Google press release for the agent development kit. The frameworks provide a kind of elaborate

infrastructure for interient communication. But almost all of it is unproductively incorrect or just wrong. But wrong in ways that only become apparent when you try to scale, which is obviously what really matters. And this is having real world implications, right? This is not just theoretical

multi- aent problems. Gartner predicts 40% of Agentic AI projects are going to be cancelled by next year, by 2027. I think they're right, and I think I know why. The teams that fail will be the ones who built just what they were told to build by looking at LinkedIn posts and X. And the strange thing is that the

practitioners who've actually scaled have converged on a completely different architecture. For example, cursor and Yagi, right? They weren't comparing nodes. They were solving the same problem. How do you run many agents without drowning in coordination overhead? and they independently

discovered the same counterintuitive solutions. So when smart people are working on the same problem without talking to each other and they arrive at the same answer, it's probably worth paying attention to, especially if the problem is one of the most highly leveraged problems in tech, which

multi-agent architecture sure is. I've spent the last couple of weeks sorting through the disagreement between what the research claims, what the frameworks recommend, and what actually works in production. And what follows are principles that hold up, the ones where theory and practice point in the same

direction. And more importantly, I want to give you a sense of why these principles work. Because 2026 is going to force us to look at problems underneath the surface that have similar underlying dynamics. This is the core insight to take with you. Simplicity scales because complexity creates serial

dependencies and serial dependencies block the conversion of compute into capability. And the conversion of compute into capability is what multi- aent architecture is all about. So let's back up a second. In December of 2025, a study from Google and MIT found something that should worry anyone

planning to scale agents this year. Adding more agents to a system can make it perform worse. Not diminishing returns, actual degradation of the system. More agents, worse outcomes. And the research called this a finding that contradicts the industry's prevailing assumption that adding additional

compute actually improves outcomes. And the intuition that doesn't work is this. If one agent finishes a task in an hour, 10 agents should be able to finish that same task in 10 times the speed in like six minutes. And this is how most computational resource allocation works. More GPUs, faster training, more

servers, higher throughput. Intuitively, you would think agents would scale the same way. But what actually happens is different. When you add agents, you add entities that need to coordinate. Every coordination point is where agents wait for each other, duplicate work, create conflicts that need resolution. And as

agent count grows, coordination overhead grows way faster than capability. Past a given threshold, 20 agents are going to produce less than three ever would. 17 are effectively standing in line. That's what serial dependency means. And the Google MIT study quantified this. one single agent accuracy exceeds about 45%

on a task. They found that adding more agents yields diminishing or negative returns. And in tool heavy environments worth 10 or more tools, multi- aent efficiency dropped by a factor of 2 to six compared to single agents. It was even more ineffective because of the multi-tool environment. In 2025, you

could avoid this by not scaling. You could just say we won't touch it. But in 2026, huge costs are going to make it not just economically attractive, but really a requirement to run hundreds of agents. The companies that give up on AI agents, as Gartner predicts, are going to be the losers. So if if you can

figure out how to deploy agents correctly, you will have an architecture that can actually take advantage of the cheap compute that's coming online. Now, the Agentic AI community has converged on design principles that feel often times like settled wisdom. And I just want to name it here because I think

it's useful. Number one, multiple specialized agents should collaborate and they should interact and delegate in patterns that mimic human teams. Agents should integrate tools at least as many as are useful for the task to extend their capabilities. They should operate continuously, accumulating context and

learning the codebase. Now you're going to have memory and context window and there's a lot of conversation about that. But there's so much conversation about longunning agents that like it's just in the water now. They should be autonomous enough to set their own sub goals without needing explicit

instructions. And you should be able to scale by just adding more of them. Now these principles, you know what's interesting? They do work at small scale. They fail at large scale in ways that frameworks don't warn you about. So the pattern across a failure mode is often the same. Intuitive

implementations will create serial dependencies between agents. And a serial dependency is any point where one agent's work blocks another, like waiting for a lock on a tool or checking a shared state or coordinating on who handles what. And at a small scale, you don't care and you get the result you

want and you see the vision realized and you think you've got it. But enough serial dependencies emerge at scale. The value of the parallelism that you created proves to be fragile. it collapses. You're paying for a 100 agents, but you're getting the throughput of five. So, the rules that

scale turn out to be different. They are the ones that eliminate serial dependencies, and they look almost too simple compared to the sophisticated architectures that seem like they should work better. But one of the big lessons of 2026 is that if you want to run hundreds of agents that you actually

use, then you need to be philosophically committed to simplicity. and you arrive there because everything else doesn't work. So here are the rules of simplicity and scaled agents. The kind of scale that gets to hundreds of agents. Number one, two tiers, not teams. So often times there's an

assumption that agents should collaborate like a human team. And cursor actually tested this directly. They gave agents equal status and let them coordinate through a shared file. Each agent could check what the others were doing and they could claim tasks and update status. It sounded wonderful,

but it failed in ways that we need to pay attention to because agents would hold locks too long. They would forget to release locks on tasks and even when locking worked, it became a bottleneck because most time in the agentic system was simply spent waiting. And so 20 agents ended up producing a 10% output,

the output of two or three agents. And they tried a simpler concurrency control, but that didn't solve it either. Either the unexpected failure mode is behavioral. With no hierarchy, a flat team of agents becomes very risk averse. They gravitate towards small safe changes. That's what cursor found.

Hard problems on that list sit unclaimed because claiming means tasking responsibility for potential failure while other agents racked up easy wins. If this sounds surprisingly human, it should. Work churned without progress. The diffused responsibility that was supposed to enable autonomy instead

meant nobody took responsibility. Again, some human human connotations here. The team dynamics metaphor imports human coordination problems that we have had for centuries. Meetings are synchronization points where everyone waits for everyone else. Status updates create read after write dependencies.

There are these technical analoges to all of our human rituals that we are sort of porting over to agents and discovering in real time don't work well. And so let's see what happens if you change that rule. If instead of assuming a flat team, you assume a strict two-tier hierarchy. Planners

create tasks. Workers execute them. A judge evaluates results. Workers do not coordinate with each other. They don't even know the other workers exist. Each picks up a task. It executes it in isolation. It pushes a change and it terminates. And you can use a tool like Git to handle conflicts after the fact.

funnily enough, Yaggi arrived at the same structure independently with his Gas Town blog post, which is very famous. His pole cats are ephemeral workers that spin up, execute a task, hand it into the merge queue, and get fully decommissioned. They do not coordinate with other workers. What he

terms the mayor sits above them creating and assigning work. The architecture emerged from four different failed orchestration patterns. And ultimately, what he learned is that peer coordination does not scale. Same thing cursor learned. And so when we look at this as a larger pattern, research on

multi- aent hierarchies backs up what cursor and Yggi are learning in practice. Two-level systems significantly outperform both flat architecture and interestingly enough deeper hierarchies as well because flat systems have maximum serial dependencies. And we've seen how that

plays out in our example. But deep hierarchies like three or more levels of agents accumulate drift as objectives mutate through delegation layers. Essentially, you're playing telephone with more layers of agents, and that doesn't work well either. So, rule number one, two-tier systems. Rule

number two, workers stay ignorant. The consensus says agents should understand context and adapt to overall goals and that smarter agents should produce better results. In fact, as we have seen hinted above, workers perform better when they're in a two-tier hierarchy and they are deliberately kept ignorant of

the big picture. So when cursors workers understood the broader project context, they experience scope creep. They decide adjacent tasks need doing or reinterpret assignments based on their understanding of the goals and every decision potentially conflicted with other workers. Resolving conflicts required

lots of coordination, serial dependencies, and just decreased agent productivity overall. A worker that only knows to implement one specific function cannot decide to refactor the whole code module. So the narrow scope you give that worker eliminates the coordination needs and enables parallel execution.

Funnily enough, Yi came to the same conclusion. His worker agents work the same way. They receive a task, they execute it, and they terminate. No knowledge of others. So I think that one of the rules that we should have when you start to scale to a 100 level agents or above is think in terms of minimum

viable context. Workers receive exactly enough to complete their assigned task and no more. Enforce this. Force it through information hiding. Do not give workers a chance to get context that could confuse them. Rule number three, also counterintuitive, no shared state. The consensus says that parallel agents

should share state to stay coordinated. The Google MIT study found the opposite. In tool heavy environments with more than 10 tools, you saw a drop in multi-agent efficiency. Tools are shared state in multi-agent environments. If multiple agents are accessing the same resources, you have contention. And

contention takes coordination. It's like fighting over the toolbox if you're in the carpenter shop. The same dynamic applies to context. funnily enough, the assumption that more tools mean more capability drives the entire MCP ecosystem where developers are connecting dozens of integration

servers. But tool selection accuracy degrades as count increases regardless of context window size. If think about it like this, you're in the carpenter shop and you go from having 10 tools you can choose from to a thousand, what is your tool selection accuracy going to look like? Yeah, it's not going to be as

good. Research shows degradation curves appearing past 30 to 50 tools even with unlimited context. And the problem is not context driven. It's not fitting the tools in the window. It's that selection accuracy drops when agents face too many choices. This is a serial dependency inside the tool catalog. Look, workers

should operate in isolation and they should have no shared state and they should have tool sets that are small like three to five core tools that are always available and others that are discoverable on demand through progressive disclosure. Coordination happens through entirely external

mechanisms that are designed for concurrent access. Git for code or task cues for a non-technical assignment. Now this does create a downstream problem, right? Isolated workers that push changes will need to merge their code. And so both Curser and Gas Town discovered you need dedicated

infrastructure to do this. Well, Yagi's Gas Town framework has what it calls the refinery, an agent responsible for merging changes. And the refinery exists because workers do not coordinate. Regardless of how you handle it, the principle is clear. The complexity of merging should not belong to the worker

and should go to a dedicated system that handles it as a cue. Rule four, plan for endings. The consensus says we should seek to increase the length of time that agents can operate continuously. Because you can accumulate context and sustain intent over time, it's such a big deal. We measure the performance of

intelligence by how long we can run our agents. But what's interesting is context accumulation creates a serial dependency with the agents own past. Because as our histories grow, context fills with information that might not be relevant. This is part of why the viral Ralph framework for Claude code is such

a big deal because the original implementation of Ralph wiped the context of the past conversation with Claude code and gave Claude code a fresh chance to attack that task. In other words, it eliminated the serial dependency on the agent's history. It enabled the agent to forget productively

because otherwise the agent doesn't forget, does it? It just stops prioritizing correctly because signal dilutes noise. Researchers call this context pollution. It causes drift. It causes progressive degradation of behavior and decision quality. And it affects a surprisingly large fraction of

longrunning agents. The problem is not just that context windows fill up. It's often that the agents attention gets diluted across the history. So even if it fits, you can get the lost inthe-middle phenomenon where models lose track of information lost somewhere in the middle of long contexts. An agent

that has been running for hours and hours has probably accumulated so much context that it will struggle to prioritize what matters now, even if what matters now is simple. Cursor found drift unavoidable during continuous operation. quality degraded within hours regardless of the context window and

specifications would mutate as agents misremembered or misinterpreted earlier choices and so the system would just start to experience entropy. It would start to lose coherence. Yaggi built this directly into Gas Town with Gup, the Gas Town universal propulsion principle. The guy must have like a

writer's DNA. It's just so fun to read him. It exists because the biggest problem with clawed code is that it ends. The context window fills up and it runs out of steam and it stops. Yaggi's words. Rather than fighting this, Gas Town treats endings as a design parameter. Sessions are just ephemeral.

Workers are expressed almost like molecules, quote unquote. They're just chains of tasks that are stored externally, and when an agent ends, the next session picks up reading the same molecular state that the worker wrote to. And if the workflow is captured as a single organic molecule state, it

survives agent crashes, compactions, restarts, and interruptions. You could think of this as a tiny little external scaffold of memory for a particular workflow that a tiny little short-lived agent is writing to. It may not ever see the end of the task. It just knows it's supposed to do this particular job. And

if it crashes or if it compacts or if anything happens, it wrote what it did down. And that is what Yaggi calls non-deterministic item potence, which is a really big word, but it means the path is unpredictable, but the outcome is guaranteed because workflow state lives outside any given agents context. And

that is powerful because the agent can then crash and restart and make mistakes and correct them and it does not matter because the workflow state tracks progress and insists on starting the next session at the correct point. And that allows that's one of the big things that allows Yuggie to productively run

dozens of agents because he's not individually assigning them tasks. He's using the workflow as an external trigger to instantiate an agent at the right. And so the rule looks like episodic operation, right? Every cycle runs for a period of time. It captures results to external storage and then you

just wash it out and kill it. And the next cycle starts fresh with clean context. And the question is not whether agents will stop working at that point. It's whether your architecture will design for endings and design workflow to persist regardless. Rule number five, this is very interesting. The consensus

says that coordination infrastructure is where a lot of the hard engineering happens in multi- aent system like how do you handle states? How do you handle errors? But cursor found that a surprising amount of behavior comes down to how we prompt our agents. Infrastructure of course does matter.

You have to have it. But prompts matter more when it comes to an analysis of failure cases. So sophisticated coordination infrastructure often adds serial dependencies rather than removing them. I'll give you some examples here. Let's say you have a message cue that serializes access to shared tools. State

synchronization requires agents to agree on what exists before proceeding. Good prompts and good isolation of agents reduces a lot of the coordination infrastructure you need to build. The whole system gets simpler because the agents are isolated. And an agent that clearly understands its role in an

isolated way is simpler to prompt. It has clear boundaries. It has clear success criteria. It doesn't need to check with other agents. This is a simpler prompt to write. You're more likely to write it correctly. So, the agent can just go and execute. And research supports that 79%

of multi- aent failures originate from spec and coordination issues, not technical bugs. And infrastructure problems account for only 16%. So systems fail because designs created serial dependencies or specs were ambiguous enough that agents did the wrong thing while functioning correctly.

So, the rule is to treat your prompts like API contracts and make sure they're in settings that are simple enough where a clear spec can allow an agent to perform well. There's an apparent contradiction here. I keep saying simplicity scales, but Yagi's Gas Town that I'm describing is actually complex.

It has seven different worker types. It has complicated words like patrols and convoys. I mean, it sounds like a science fiction novel. The resolution is this complexity can live in agents or in the orchestration layer that keeps simple agents running. And these have very different scaling properties. And

that's the heart of what I'm talking about here because complexity in agents does work at a small scale, but it creates serial dependencies that break at larger scales. So an agent that gets entangled with other agents works when you have three to five in the system. But what Yggi found out is that you

cannot do that if you get into dozens of agents, let alone the hundreds that Kurser was working on. Complexity and orchestration enables parallelism. So Gast Town has a separate role for an agent that just notices when worker agents get stuck because worker agents are that simple. It has separate agents

that just focus on merging conflicts. The orchestration complexity exists because the agents are simple and simple agents do need external systems to keep them running and to feed them work and to merge their outputs and to track progress. This is the inverse of where a lot of teams are putting complexity in

multi- aent systems and it's the heart of why so many multi- aent systems fail. The intuition is that if you make agents smarter and more capable and more autonomous, you're going to push intelligence down to the workers and scale the ability of compute to convert to capability. Remember that phrase?

That's what we're after. But that just doesn't work. The architecture that scales keeps workers pretty dumb. The implication for 2026 is that the investment should go into orchestration and not into agent intelligence. Build systems that can feed and monitor and merge the outputs of hundreds of simple

workers. Do not build super elaborate agents. The implications here are that teams that win the year will be the ones that can absorb the tremendous increase of compute we're on schedule for. Assume another 10x who can add agents and get proportional throughput gains instead of a coordination collapse. And so you need

to think in tiers, two tiers specifically. You need to think about isolating your workers, about having external orchestration so that complexity lives at the systems layer, not the agent layer. You need to think about how agents end. You need to think about how you can have a system simple

enough that your prompts can drive agent performance and you don't have to spend a tremendous amount on agent coordination with engineering and small tool sets. Guys, it is possible to get to hundreds of agents. It is possible to get to hundreds of thousands of codes of lines of code written autonomously. I've

seen it over and over and over again. But the teams that succeed understand that the job is not to give the agent too much scope. The job is not to make one brilliant Jason Bourne agent running around for a week. It's actually 10,000 dumb agents that are really well coordinated in the system running around

for an hour at a time progressively getting work done against a very tight definition of the goal they're accomplishing. That is the transition we are living through. That is what multi- aent systems are going to look like in 2026. And the teams who understand this are going to outproduce the teams that

don't by a factor of 100. And that is not an exaggeration. That is why the stakes are so high. And so there you go. That is your multi- aent toolkit right there. That is how teams actually build multi- aent systems that scale. Good luck.
