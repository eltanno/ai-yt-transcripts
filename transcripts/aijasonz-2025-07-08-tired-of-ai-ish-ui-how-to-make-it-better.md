Most time when we ask cursor to generate UI at default always generate this type of UI that you look at it you know it's AI generated. So for the past few days I've been looking to how can you get a model to generate much more personalized and unique design that has your branding interesting interaction pattern and most

importantly once you have one UI component that meets your quality and taste. You can scale it to all sorts of different UI components that has the same standard and quality across your whole application. And here I want to showcase what my overall workflow is so that you can really level up the design

large model produce for you. And firstly I want to talk about a concept called flow engineer. It is something Andrew Kepsi mentioned about one and a half years ago. Instead of prompt engineer we just give model a prompt and expect output something. The most sophisticated way is actually distill the expertise

knowledge into a flow so that the output from the larger learning model can be constructed iteratively. And what I mean by that is instead of try to figure out the perfect prompt possible, try to think about what are the core elements a really senior designer going to do to produce a unique design. From my

experience as designer, normally I would design in multiple different steps. I will firstly try to figure out layout. What type of user journey will be so that I can decide the information hierarchy and once I confirm the layout then I'll try to figure out the right scene the branding so that I can put

together a high fidelity mockup. And meanwhile, I also want to add a little bit touch of animation. Only after that, we can start implementing on the front end. And at each step, large length model might produce multiple different results. I will iterate until I get one version that I like. And this four steps

I list out here are just a starting point that I experimented past few days. There are a lot more things can be tried and think about like the reference mode, user flow as well as content hierarchy. So there are a lot more things can be experimented, but I will just talk about this basic flow that I tried so far and

really to get you guys to experiment different things. First, I want to talk about layout. This is like a typical oneshot UI you would get from those model. It kind of feels functional, but a lot of detail just didn't look right. For example, this didn't make sense to be centered. It should probably be left

aligned and also it might miss some information that I think is useful like a description of the property and some call to action button. And once I found really useful is actually align on the layout pretty early on. One interesting experience I found is you can actually use key as a very quick and fast way to

align the layout with large language model. There was one time I tried to build a chat UI and I just prompted to hey help me think through the layout first. The model just output the whole UI in asky and that was time I was quite surprised because it is actually pretty effective way for me to understand did a

model understand what I want. Did it actually cover all the functionality that I intended to implement but most importantly it is way faster for a model to generate asky wireframe like this rather than implementing whole HTML or react page. So quite typical I went through when I was designing super

design or even in cursor is that I will ask it to quickly output ask key wireframe of what the UI should look like and you can see here this is real time I haven't added it's super fast I get a quick result within like 1 second and then I can quickly give feedback to realign what I want then it will very

quickly generate a kind of new UI for me and obviously we can like back and forth a few times so this is extremely fast and cheap way for me to align with model about what the layout should look like and dramatically increase the chance that the output it generate is going to satisfy our needs and you can even use

that to communicate some interaction as well. In this example where I try to demonstrate the chat UI, it will firstly generate this main UI of chat but also show me when user click on hamburger menu a sidebar should show up that push the main interface away. It can also handle some bit more sophisticated UI

like crypto trading it will have some creative way to figure out how to present and communicate UI with you. And with that I even tried something more kind of like creative work. This is what I got when I asked it to like design a poster for AI builder club and it is also able to generate those type of

content hierarchy or post hierarchy for me and modal actually follow as layout pretty well in the end it can output proper graphic design poster for me with some special layout like this triangle shape which is not something that super common it will get one shot by itself. Those downside I found is that once you

do use ASKI it tend to make the UI a bit too simplified cuz in ASKI there's no easy way to indicate like this font should be bigger than the rest. So the content hierarchy does feel like a bit too simplified but I feel like with some experiments we can either keep ask Yframe as right abstraction level or we

can figure out some new level of abstraction to communicate layout. So this is the first step of layout alignment and second step of flow is same. So same including things like color font shadow border radio all sorts of things. This is probably the biggest and easiest leverage you can get to make

a default AIish UI into something that feels really personalized onto your branding. And there are multiple ways for you to get the style right. You can either go to dribble mob or any website to get some UI reference and just copy the image over and ask cursor or super design to extract CSS stylesheet from

the UI mock. But generally I found if you start from mock up it normally get to like 80%. It's almost never look like 100% similar. That's where a platform like Twix CN is really really useful. So Twixen is a platform that really just focusing on scene design. So you can come here, change the color, font,

shadow, border, all sort of things to create very different and unique style and this is where your human taste comes in to create something truly different things like font where have really big kind of impact of the design as well as the primary colors and they provide this type of UI for you to play with the

style and once you get the style right you can click on the code button and just copy the stylesheet over to cursor or super design and they will just try to replicate the same style for you. What you find is that once you have the style confirmed, the UI quality just became dramatically better. Like in this

example, this is what I originally got from cloud. With some style change, I can make it look something like this, which is really different or high quality compared with what you normally get from AI. In super design also streamline this process of same generation as well. So after confirm the

layout of UI, it will generate a list of stylesheets which I can preview to see what kind of style it will be and if I don't like certain style, I can ask to generate again until I got something that I really like. The point here is that you do want to allocate certain amount of token to just designing the

scene and making sure it produce something that looks like what you want. Again, this is one of the key factors that will make your UI dramatically better. Last but not least, animation. So sometimes certain UI feels really good is not because just it looks better, but also it has like micro

interaction sync through like inline editing with a nice style already, the nice hover effects, the sliding and slide out interactions and make UI feels from good to great. And I find that you can actually very easily just prompt the agent think through the key user interactions and animation design. I

will try to get it be concise and just communicate and represent animation in simple format like this which is what type of elements need to be animated. What are the key frames and when should be triggered. I found even as simple as this. It already give model a good amount of context to know that they need

to consider those interactions when they build a UI. And there are some probably more advanced things you can do as well like ask to generate a user flow of key interactions in mermaid chart. A mermaid chart is type of graph representation in format like left side. Surprisingly large language model is really good at

understanding those type of mermaid chart and it can also go a bit more advanced as well to like really list out all the interactions into things through but those are probably more useful for some complex projects. For most of project you can just go as simple as just ask a model to sync through the

animations and spit out a key frame like this. And what's really cool is that once you spend time to get one component right then you can scale to all the other UI components you want and build together a page. For example, here I got this probably listing card that I'm pretty happy with. Then I will just

prompt cursor or super design saying great. Now help me generate another view which is calendar view to help people book inspections. With that prompt again it will confirm my layout with me. Then design styling and animation and in the end I'll put a calendar component which actually looks pretty good. It has same

set of styling and interactions. And after that I also ask to generate map view. Then generating me this map view with same button content style and animations as well as the price history card that I can chuck into the property detail page. So you can imagine you can just keep going build out whole UI

components and give all those things as context to model say now put together a page for me with all those components and those are just flow steps I have experienced so far for past few days. There are a lot more things you can also experiment on your end to figure out which part are actually helping a lot in

terms of output. Meanwhile, also baking this workflow in super design extension. And if you don't know super design, it is open source project Jack and I have been building. It is basically a cursor extension that you can just open inside your IDE to start generating UI. It is totally public and free to use. It will

firstly propose and generate the layout and then it can generate the same and when we have some kind of nice UX for you to just preview the same here and you can ask it to iterate multiple times and in the end it will pull everything together and you will have this kind of infinite canva directly in ID to preview

all different variations of the UI in the same screen. But if you want to learn more in depths about this kind of fourstep UI flow, I actually articulate those into a prompt that I normally use for cursor cloud code and super design in the AI builder club which is a community I have building where we have

group of top AI builders who are launching and building AI products. Myself and other people were just keep sharing some in-depth learnings and workflows of how to build and launch AI products where I have some instruction about styling icons scripts and the most importantly is a workflow here. I asked

it to follow this workflow of layout design, scene design, the core animation design, then generate the actual UI with more detailed breakdown example which I initially just copy those prompt and create a custom mode in cursor or cloud code almost immediately gets better results. So if you're interested, you

can click on the link in the description below. I'll continue to explore more ways to make the UI generation easier and faster and better. And if you know any good tips about UI AI generate design, please let me know. I would love to hear. Thank you and I see you next time.
