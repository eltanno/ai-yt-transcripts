Thanks to HubSpot for sponsoring this video. So, something really big actually happened December 2025 and most of people didn't even realize that. Entry Cupsy tweet about this last week. It's very hard to communicate how much programming has changed due to AI in the last two months, specifically since last

December. And Greg from OpenAI also talked about this. Since December, there's step function improvements in what model and tools are capable of. and a few engineers had told him that their job has fundamentally changed since December 2025. So what actually happened in December 2025? In short words, the

latest model introduced in is finally ready for fully autonomous longrunning tasks. So with AI, the ultimate dream is always that while we are sleeping, AI can just work on task fully autonomously 24/7. Even back 2023, the most popular project if you remember is called AutoGBT. It is first time those 40

autonomous agentic system was introduced and they have fairly basic and simple architecture that using GP4 as a model to autonomously break down a list of tasks based on users go and has simple memory storage to store the result and people were doing some pretty crazy stuff like just give a go make a

$100,000 and let it loop through task infinitely until completed. Back then the system just break and fail miserably because the model is simply not ready. But since December last year this really changed. The models have significantly higher quality long-term coherence and they can parse through much larger and

longer tasks and we saw all sort of different experimentation came out from industry. Firstly from January we got this super hot concept called rough loop and most of basic and simple agent iteration loop to force model work longer so that it can take more complex tasks. They just for loop the model with

some simple condition checks. But already we start seeing the difference. And one week later, cursor also released their experimentation where they use GPD 5.2 to autonomously build a browser from scratch with 3 million lines of code. And entropic also released this experimentation they had where they get

a team of cloud codes to autonomously working on a s compiler from scratch for two weeks and in the end it delivered a functional version with zero manual coding. It can even run doom inside this compiler as well. And same time open claw start getting attention and had this explosive growth that we never seen

before. And it was very difficult to understand what was going on with open claw cuz from outside it's very easy to categorize open claw just be another menace but live inside your own computer and can also access from telegram like why this so popular and only later after I use deep player I realized that the

real difference is that open claw represent this type of always on longunning fully autonomous agents that is very different from all the other agentic system we used before where human is main driver to prompt for the next action. Open claw is always on and it is peractive. And this autonomous

feeding is created by a fairly simple architecture where it has memory context layer with a trigger and chron job to autonomously take actions and have the full computer access which is powerful environment it can operates in. And I believe open claw is the first project that really open up the biggest paradigm

shift in 2026 that we are moving from a co-pilot simple task based agent system to those long running fully autonomous agent. Something that's always on always ready autonomously delivering super complex coordinated work. This is a critical shift you have to understand. The model today is actually much more

powerful than you think as long as you design right assist system to unlock it. And this is the crux of what I want to talk about today. the harness engineer to reable long running autonomous systems. If it's the first time you hear about harness engineer, this is like evolution from what we've been

previously talked about which is context engineer or prompt engineer. So previously we really focus on how do you optimize the prompts within the effective context window to get a model have the best performance for a single agent loop session. But harness engineer is really focused on those long

runninging tasks which means how do you design a system that can works across different sessions and multiple different agents and how do you design the right workflow to making sure the relevant context will be retrieved for each session and right set of toolings to extract most out of models. This is a

fairly new concept but the good thing is that industry already converged on some best practice that you can use from entropic versel lanching and many others more goes through each one of them one by one so you can see the patterns but before we dive into this with this paradigm shift fully atoms agents one of

the biggest opportunity for the next six 12 months is build open cloth for a certain verticals which means you deeply investigate and understand the end-to-end workflow of a certain vertical and build a Tom's agent with the correct environment and tooling to enable the end toend process that's why

I want to introduce you to this awesome research HubSpot did on the AI adoption in email marketing report. It is fascinating report for you to understand for a vertical like email marketing where people actually use AI today and what has gaps because this report showcase clear workflow and opportunity

in email marketing that you can potentially automate. They survey hundreds of email marketers from top companies to understand exactly how AI is reshaping their workflows. They talk about why marketers are still doing a lot of heavy editing. What were the cost to it as well as the biggest challenge

they are facing today when implementing AI in the email marketings and each of them is a big opportunity for you to build a fully autonomous agents. They even dive into the specific KPI that they care more about and AI has showed proven results as well as what exactly things email marketers are really want

from AI. So if you're a builder who are thinking about the next bit agent product to build, I highly recommend you go check out this awesome resource. I put a link in the description below for you to download for free and thanks HubSpot for sponsoring this video. Now let's get back to harness engineer for

long running agent systems and at high level there are three learnings I took away from those. One is that for long running task agents the critical part of system design is creating this legible environment where each sub agent or sessions can actually understand where things are at and most likely there are

some workflows that can be done to enforce legibility of the environment and I'll expand a bit more on that. The second is verification is critical. You can improve system output significantly by allowing it to verify its work effectively with faster feedback loop. And third is that we need to trust the

model more. Instead of building specialized tooling that wrap a lot of reasoning and logic prematurely, we should give model max context with generic tooling that they natively understand and let it just explore like human. And I'll unpack those three things one by one as we go through each

block here. Firstly, this entropics effective harness for long running agents blocks. So they've experimented using cloud code SDK to build a specialized agent for super long running tasks like build a clone of claw.ai website and the very first failures they observe is that firstly agent tend to do

too much at once. Essentially it will always try to oneshot the whole app and this led to the model running out of context in the middle of its implementation and leaving the next session to start with the feature half implemented or documented. Then the agent would have to guess what actually

happened and spend substantial time trying to get the basic app working again. And second failure they observe is that agent tend to declare job complete prematurely. You probably experienced this a few times yourself as well. The cloud code or cursor will just claim the pure or feature is completed

but once you test it it actually didn't work. So their approach to solve those default model failure behavior is that first they set up initial environment that lays the foundation for all the features that given prompt requires which set up the agent to work step by step and feature by feature. So this is

kind of similar to the plan or PRD approach that we normally took and second is that it start prompt each agent to make incremental progress towards its goal while also leaving the environment in clean state at the end of each session. What they did is starting designed this two-part solution. First

they will have this initializer agent that use a specialized prompt to ask model to set up initial environment with a insh script which will set up dev server for example so that next model don't need to worry about those things and also a claw progress.txt txt file that keeps logs on what agent have done

as well as initial get commit that shows what file has been added. Then a coding agent for each subsequent session to ask a model to make incremental progress then leave structured updates and all those efforts are really try to serve one purpose is how can they define an environment where agents can quickly

understand the state of work when starting with a fresh context window. So the workflow is that the initializer agent would firstly try to set up a environment or you can call it documentation system to track and maintain overall plan and environment they design here is firstly they will

have a feature list documents to prevent agent oneshotting the whole app or prematurely considering the project complete. Instead they will get initializer agent to break down the project into over 200 features and lock them in a local JSON file looks something like this where each task has

detailed spec as well as pass or fail state. At default all task will be marked as fail. So force model to always look at overall project goal and the progress pick up highest priority task and do the next thing. But to make this workflow works they also need a way to force a model leave the environment in a

clean state after making the code change. In their experiment they found the best way is to ask a model to commit its progress to git with descriptive commit message and write a summary of its progress in progress file. But with just documentation and context environment itself is not enough because

mono at default has this tendency to mark something as completed without proper testing. And at the beginning they were just prompting cloud code to always do the test after the code change by doing unit test or API test for the dev server. But all those things were often failed to recognize that a feature

is not working end to end. But things really start changing when they give model proper tooling to do the end to end test by itself like puppeteer mcp or chrome dev tool where agent was able to identify and fix bug that were not directly obvious from the code itself. So basically they are setting up the

structure where they have the initialized agent to break down the user's goal into a list of features alongside insh to be able to run the dev server and progress files. So next coding agent can just read the feature list to get understanding about the overall project plan and pick up high

priority task and progress file and get log to understand where things are at. Then run in.sh to start dev server immediately and do end to end test to verify the environment is clean so that it can get a full picture faster feedback loop while each new session and context window happen. In open AI's blog

they talk about very similar thing. You have to making sure your application environment is legible. make the whole repository knowledge the system or record. Initially they put a gigantic agents.mmd file and fail in predictable ways because it's just too much context for any agent to manage and maintain. So

what they did is design a proper dock environment structure and treated agents.md file as a table of contents. So they set up this documentation system from architectures the design docs the execution plan DB schema product specs and design front end plan security and many more and put this table of content

into agents.mmd file so the agent can actually retrieve back relevant information when needed and this enables progressive disclosure and open actually do it even further they will try to push not only the code knowledge but also Google doc slack message all those other fragmented information feed data into

the repository as a repository local version artifacts. So the agent can also retrieve because from the agent point of view if anything can't be accessed in the environment then effectively it didn't exist. But again documentation itself didn't really keep a fully agent generated codebase coherent. They also

introduce certain programmatic workflow to enforce invariance. For example, they layer domain architecture with explicit crosscutting boundaries which allow them to enforce those rules with custom checks, llinters and structural tests which can be automatically triggered and injected by every git pre-commit and

those type architecture usually you will postpone until you have hundreds of engineer in traditional software company. But with coding agent is an early prerequisite. Within those boundaries, you allow teams and agent to significant freedom in how solutions are expressed without micromanaging and

worry the architecture going to drift. Meanwhile, they also improve the codebase a lot. For example, they made the app bootable per g work tree. So, so codex can just launch and drive many different instance and they also wire chrome dev to protocol into the agent runtime so that the agent can reproduce

bugs valid fix by DOM snapshots, screenshots and navigation. And with all environment and workflow set up, the repository finally cross a minimum threshold where codecs can end to end drive a new feature. So every time when codex receive a single prompt, the agent will start validate the current state of

codebase, reproduce a reported bug, record a video demonstrate the failure, implement a fix, validate fix by driving the application, record a second video demonstrating the resolution and eventually merge the change. So those two blocks jook is very good learnings and necessary harness system you need to

put in place for fully autonomous system. Meanwhile, there also third learnings. Quite often when we build agents, especially vertical specific agents, our tendencies to build specialized tooling to do domain specific task. The learning god is that large learning model almost always work

better with generic tool that they natively understand. Versel released this awesome article about how they redesign their test to SQL agent. So they spent months building sophisticated internal text to SQL agent DZ with specialized to heavy prompt engineering and careful context management. But as

many of us experienced before those type of system kind of work but it's very fragile slow and require constant maintenance because every new edge cases happen you need to inject new prompt to the agent but later they tried one thing that totally changed the trajectory they deleted most of the specialized tool

from the agent down to a single batch command tool and with this much simpler architecture the agent actually performed 3.5 times faster with 37% fewer tokens and success rate increased from 80% to 100%. Similar learning has been shared from entropy team as well where they talk about instead of having

specialized search linked execute tools they just have one batch tool where you can run grip t npm npm run linked and fundamentally I think it's because all those large model is much more familiar with those code native tools that has billions of training tokens versus bespoke tool calling JSON that it need

to generate and I've talked about this in programmatic tool calling video that I released last week and I believe it is similar fundamental principles here but the foundation of those simple architecture is again the good context and documentation environment where model can use generic tools to retrieve

context progressively and it is same case with open claw. One reason open claw is so interesting is that they have a surprisingly simple but effective context environment. They have list of documentations to store core information with this foundation. They only have the most basic tooling like read, write,

edit files, run batch commands and send messages. All the risk is coming from giving agent environment to retrieve relevant contexts plus a big skill libraries to expand capabilities. So those are three practical learnings about how to do harness engineer for long running complex agents by setting

up a legible context environment to enable each session to grab context effectively and write workflow and tooling so that model can verify it work effectively drive faster feedback loop and trust agent with generic tools that it natively understands. If you're interested, I'm going to share more in

depth about how do I take this learnings and transform into a development life cycle process in AI builder club. We have courses and work through about VIP coding and building production agents. And every week myself and industry experts share the latest practical learnings. So if you're interested in
