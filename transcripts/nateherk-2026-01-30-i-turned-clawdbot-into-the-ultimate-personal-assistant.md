## Transcript

Last night, I was laying in bed and I texted Klouse to build me a YouTube dashboard. And I told her that I was about to go to sleep so that I wouldn't be around. So, it spun up the initial page and then it gave itself six more to-dos that it would take care of while I was sleeping. And then when I woke up

and I opened up my computer, I had this. I've got a YouTube analytics dashboard where I can track my 7-day stats, my 30-day stats. I can look at my videos and see how they're performing relative to other videos. I've got a hub to look at all my comments, whether that's hot topics, common questions, pain points,

or just looking at all the recent comments on here. It's able to pull in competitor videos and see which of these are breaking out. And then it uses all of that data to help me come up with ideas. So, it comes up with titles for YouTube videos that I could make based on my audience and based on the trends.

This is just V1. It did this while I was sleeping. So, this is my dashboard that my ultimate assistant Klouse built for me. In here, I can see all the tasks that he's working on, what's in the backlog, and I can even see up here when he's actually working or when he's not. So,

last night before I go to bed, I basically say, "Hey, all night when I'm sleeping, I want you to build me a YouTube dashboard." And so we put together a speclist. He threw all of his tasks in the to-do section as you can see. So of course I go to bed. I wake up feeling like a kid on Christmas. And

then I check in on the morning and he says, "The YouTube dashboard MVP is done." And so I come into the dashboard this morning and I can see that everything has now been moved over here to done. And this is what we got. So hopping back into my Cloud dashboard, if I now go to the log, I can see

everything that he does. So if I scroll down to where it would have been this morning. So last night I went to bed at like midnight. So right here is where I started this. And then after we kicked off all the spec docs and I added all of these tasks to his backlog. Look what he did. 12:31 did something. 12:48, 1:15,

142, 208, 234, like all night up until like 7 when I checked in on him and he started doing some daily pull stuff in the morning. He was just working on the YouTube dashboard all night long. So I mean, if that doesn't at least get you a little bit excited, then I don't know what will. So today I'm going to be

going over this dashboard, how I built it, how you can create your own version of Clouse. So, pretty much everything that I've done with my Clawbot here and then I'm going to talk about five hacks for a smarter assistant because it is a really smart tool, but there's a lot of things that you have to overcome and

I've had a lot of frustration when I was building out this dashboard and getting clouds to work in a way that actually makes me more efficient rather than less. Now, the reason that I'm actually so excited by this and I've been having so much fun with it is because it's like the end ultimate assistant except for it

is 15 times more powerful. This is one of the videos I made about Enidend that went viral and it's the ultimate assistant which I've configured to have an email agent, a calendar agent, contact agent, content creator agent, a search tool. If you think about it, the functionality is really not that much.

We're able to talk to it through Telegram and it responds to us in Telegram. And so all of the sub aents I obviously had to build. So for example, the email agent looks like this with all the email tools. And if I wanted to add a different type of agent, I would have to go into Niten and build that out. But

what happens with Claus is really cool because it's like let's say you have five functions and if you want to figure out if you can do something else like hey Claus can you send voice notes? Sure let me just research how that works. Okay cool here's how I could do that. Do you want me to actually build this in?

So basically any feature that you could describe Klouse will figure out how to do it and if it's possible it will just do it for you. What's on your end of course is actually maybe going and creating an API and putting that in your or maybe going and paying for a plan and then giving him that username or

something like that. So yeah, here's where I put in my Claus master guide access and capabilities. Right now, this is what it's got access to. GitHub, Brave Search, OpenAI, 11 Labs, PDF Shift, Appify, ClickUp, Google Workspace, and then some YouTube stuff like that. We've got understanding of

how the memory system works. It understands when to send voice notes, which is only when I send him a voice note. Here we have some information on what it should do freely and what would require permission. And then you can see what we've built together. So the first one is obviously the cloud dashboard,

and here's what it does. We've got the YouTube intelligence dashboard, and here's what it does. I'm still impressed that it built this while I was sleeping. Super cool. It can do branded PDF reports and then it has scheduled triggers to do things like daily pulses, audits, email monitoring, checking

tasks, and obviously this isn't completely updated because I added some more stuff in after this guide. All right, so before we actually break down exactly what I've done and how you can replicate this, let's just go over a few more features in this dashboard so you can get a feeling of what I've actually

built here with Klouse. So, of course, we are talking to Klaus through Telegram. And you can see the last thing I just had him make a change. I said, "This is perfect. You're the best." and he reacted to my text, which I thought was pretty cool that they can react. And then the reason why it says model

claopus 4x5 is because I wanted to have visibility. So every time I messaged him, I told him to tell me what model he's using. So this started as a pretty simple dashboard just so I could track what was going on. But I told him, "Hey, your job is to save me time. I want you to be proactive, understand my

workflows, and suggest things all the time." So specifically in this dashboard while we were building it together, I said, "Suggest features, whatever you think might work and whatever you think will help you work better and help me work better. Just tell me that you're going to implement it." And so one of

the first things that he did was he built this little thing up in the top left so that I can actually see him, which was a little bit scary, but also kind of cool because now I can look over and I can see if it's idle, then he's not working on anything. But if he's thinking or working, then I know that

there is something going on. So let me go ahead and shoot something off and we will see him spin up and start working. All right. So, just to start off here, I'm saying, "Hey, Klaus, I need you to spin up a sub agent to do some in-depth research about what's going on today with Naden. There was some news about a

security thing, and I want you to create a report for me." So, obviously, we can see up here that it is thinking. It also has spun up a sub agent, which we are able to visually see, which is pretty cool. And I will get back to you once we have that report. And of course, it was able to add an inrogress task right

here. And then when it's done, hopefully it should move it over to done. But that's a really cool thing about this Cananban board is that if I have a task and I come in here and I just add a new to-do, then Claus will automatically pick that up and start working on it. Or similarly, if I give him a note down

here, I can send something off just for him to log it in his memory. Or even if I wanted to take action on it. So like here, I said testing if this works. When you see this, tell me a joke. And then it shot me a joke in my telegram. And every time it actually acknowledges these, it marks them as seen by Clouse.

So I know which ones it's processed or not. So here's a great example of how it knows about me and my business because it came back and said the TLDDR is anyone running any needs to upgrade because of this vulnerability. So do you want me to turn this into some content for you? Because it could be a quick

YouTube short or community post which is the kind of thing that your audience needs to hear about fast. But anyways, I just said no post for now. I just want the report. So it's throwing that together now. All right. So it said that the report is done. If I close out of Telegram, we should see that this got

moved to done. And the reason why it's a different color is because these are actually a priority switch, not like a a status. As you can see, if I move this over here, it's just a priority thing. So anyways, if I go ahead and click on the docs tab right here in our dashboard, you can see that we have a

new doc about security, which is end security vulnerability report. So now I'm able to actually read through this entire report that it made. We've got the date, classification, the exact summary, vulnerability details, and we can continue to scroll down and see this entire markdown format report that it

was able to make for us. And if I wanted to change anything about this, I could go ahead and edit it, and then it would bring up this editor for us to change something in the doc, save it. So now we have a really cool place where every single time that we ask Claus to create some sort of file for us, it's able to

just drop it in here, and then we can look at it and save it. So I thought I'd show you guys off one of those heartbeat functionalities. And I'll explain exactly what a heartbeat is and how that works in a bit. But I'm going to go ahead and add a new task right here that just says, um, make Nate laugh. And I'm

just gonna say, "Usually in the afternoon, Nate gets sad, so tell him a joke about AI." So, while we're waiting for Claus to actually pick that up and shoot me off a joke, let's see what we have done here, which are some of our scheduled deliverables, which are workflows that happen either daily or

weekly. So, for example, with the weekly YouTube audits, every single week on I think it's like Monday night or Sunday night, I'm going to get one of these YouTube audits. And obviously here, I was playing around with some different formats, but this is kind of what they look like now. They have my brand

information, although this one didn't have the logo. Let's try this one. It'll have my logo. It'll have my brand guidelines. And it sends me a SWAT analysis and a YouTube channel audit about strengths, weaknesses, metrics, and some other things that we need to do. Obviously, there's a bit of a

spacing issue here, but we get some recent content analysis, strategic recommendations. And what you'll notice here is that we're signed in here as Klouse. So, Klouse has its own Gmail, Drive, Docs, Sheets, its own accounts for pretty much everything because I didn't want it to be in my environment.

I wanted to treat this as a person that I could talk to, forward emails to and have it respond like that. So, it created a drive called cloud deliverables and that's where it was able to store all of these things like the daily pulses, the SWAT analysis, the logos, audits, and YouTube audits. So,

obviously security is a huge topic when we're talking about Cloudbot. So, the security audit that I had it run for me here, this was actually just a Google doc rather than a PDF, but it pointed out all these issues. It ranked them for different risk levels, and then I was able to have Claus just go ahead and fix

all these things. And I'm constantly checking with Klouse to make sure that we are completely fine and that our port's not exposed and stuff like that. And obviously I'm not like a security expert. So I'm doing the best that I can working with Klouse with cloud code with perplexity figuring out how I can be

safe. But everyone out there that wants to experiment with cloudbot, just make sure that you are thinking about security and not giving access to tons of different random things if you don't really know what's going on. Okay, so what I did is I said, "How often does your heartbeat run and what does it

actually do?" And it said that my heartbeat runs every 30 minutes. And every time that my heartbeat runs, it basically wakes up Klaus. And Claus will make sure that both the dashboards are running. It will do a sync. It will check for notes, which you can see it actually just moved the make Nate laugh

from in progress to done, I believe. As you can see, it will monitor X and Twitter. It will do a daily pulse. And the idea is that I wake up with no memory. So when I have my heartbeats, I stay proactive and I check in on things and do things in the background for you. So anyways, then it said, "Yep, just saw

that task Q. Make Nate laugh high priority." And the joke is, what do you call an AI that finally passes the touring test? Unemployed, the humans just move the goalpost again. I don't really get that one. So, let's actually move on to the next part, which is how can you create your own version of

Klouse? So, the first thing, of course, you want to do is set up Cloudbot. Whether you're going to do that on a Mac Mini or whether you're going to do that on VPS, I will tag a full setup guide video right up here that I made a few days ago and you can get that set up on a VPS. So what I actually did is I came

into Klaus and I was like, "Hey, I want to teach my YouTube channel how they can basically build exactly what I built for you and how we configure you." So I had it create this guide called build your own Klouse, a step-by-step guide to creating an AI executive assistant. Clouse handles daily briefings, monitors

my business, runs security audits, and proactively services opportunities, and you can build your own version. So time investment, 4 to 6 hours over the weekend to get the core system running, and cost about 50 bucks a month. I'm going to say that it's going to be higher than that. So, I've obviously

spent lots of hours playing around with Cloudbot, doing different things, and I spun up this one to turn this into an executive assistant. And you can see with just this specific Cloudbot that I'm using, Klouse, I've used almost a quarter of a billion tokens in the past just 3 days, which translate to about

$223 in actual money. But keep in mind, all of this has been done with Opus 4.5. So, if you went to Sonnet 4.5 or if you use a locally hosted model, your cost would be less. And the reason why I'm not using like my max plan, the $200 a month plan for which I would get way more

tokens with is because Anthropic has been banning accounts left and right for violating terms of service. So if you are currently using Cloudbot with a max plan or any Cloud plan at all, you have to switch it over to API. So anyways, what happens when you actually get this set up? Well, you have to get onboarded.

So the first thing it's going to start to do is it's going to start to ask you questions. So you have to give it an identity. You have to talk about who are you, what its role is, what you want it to do, how it should behave, and you should also just brain dump everything about you and your business. So, I spent

like almost an hour just talking to Claudebot, talking to Klouse, letting him get to know me. I'm telling him, ask me questions. What do you not know about me? What do you need to know more about? And this ends up creating a soul file. So, the soul.md is basically who is your AI and what's its job? And then also

creates a user.md file, which is basically who am I and what do I do? So, right here, I just asked Claus to summarize the soul and user files. And it came back with, "I'm Klouse, your executive assistant. My job is to log everything, track all my work, communicate casual but concise, be

resourceful, and the user summary is that you are Nate based in Chicago. Your background is nontechnical, graduated May 24, blah blah blah." So, it knows all of this kind of stuff about my business, about the platform, even know some people on my team and stuff like that. So, here's where I talk about

having the getting to know you conversation, of course, covering everything that you want it to know about your business. And then, like I said, prompt the AI to ask you questions and be proactive about it. and the AI will basically interview you which makes everything better. So step two is to

create dedicated accounts for your AI. So I don't think that you should be giving Klouse or whatever you call it access to your accounts directly. I didn't want Claus to be logged in as you know my main email or my main calendar or my main ClickUp cuz you just don't really know what could happen. So

instead if I give it an email account and I wanted to help me manage my email, well I can just forward at things and I can CC him on things and that way he's kind of looped in as I would treat an actual like executive assistant. The way that I think about it is if you had like a VA or someone that you brought onto

the team and you wanted to take on a lot of administrative roles, would you give them right away like credit card information, bank account information, passwords, access to everything? I I probably wouldn't. And on top of that, Claus has its own Drive, Docs, Calendar, so that it can see my calendar and it

can, you know, share files with me and request access, but it's not actually going to be deleting things from my environment just in case. Same thing for task management. It's got a ClickUp account. It can view my list. It can see what's going on in the business, but it's not able to really delete things

and change anything unless I give it specific access to do so. And I put it in its own environment with its own list that I manage my tasks on now that it can actually like change things and move them around just to see how it's going to work. And then of course, when it comes to credentials, you want to be

storing this in av file. You don't want to give it straight to Klaus in a conversation history in Telegram in the, you know, hub. So you can say, "Hey Claus, I don't want you to ever mention an API key in our conversation. I just want you to use placeholders and just help me get into myv file and I can drop

them in there." So you can either do that through your terminal or you can just open up in your file explorer and go to thev file and add in all of your API keys. So then of course on top of this I just gave it read access to pretty much everything. All the APIs that it needs to use for you know

analytics or appy and things like that. I gave it pretty much read access unless it needs to do something. And if it needs to do something, I would set up like a spending limit or I would just basically make sure that there's very strict permissions. So it can look at my calendar. I can forward it emails. It

has visibility into my tasks. And it has access to certain things that I have as far as like socials, but it can only read and extract information. So it can't post on my Twitter or reply to things on YouTube or Twitter, but it can grab a bunch of data, which is super helpful. So phase four is about

developing the proactive mindset. This is where it gets really, really powerful and where it starts to feel different than just like a cloud code or, you know, an NN AI agent. So, I'm consistently telling it, you know, I'm running a lean business. I want to save time. I want you to figure out

opportunities to be proactive and make my life as easy as possible. Only loop me in when you really need something from me. So, you can say something like, "Based on everything you know about me, my business, and my goals, what are all the ways that you could proactively help me? Don't wait for me to ask, but what

would you do if your job was to save me time every single day?" And after that, it just started brainstorming and it suggested a ton of ideas. So, at the moment, the proactive things that I have it doing are this. I've got a morning AI news briefing. And it's not just general, it's also like super specific

to me. I've got ClickUp task summaries every day. So, every morning it looks at my ClickUp and it says, "Hey, here's what you've got today." And also, it will try to give me things proactively if it can help with any of those. So, sometimes it'll do extra research for me. If it's like a content flow or if

I've got a really busy day, it can maybe suggest moving some of my, you know, events on my calendar, things like that. It does email monitoring every single 10 minutes. So, in its inbox, if I ever send it something, it should respond within 10 minutes or it should, you know, kick off research or do something

else about it in 10 minutes. And with the dashboard notes, it's supposed to check this every 5 minutes, but we just saw an example where it thought it was every 30. So, there is a bit of a back and forth. I will say the persistent memory is cool, but it's not perfect at all because it chooses what memories to

store and then sometimes it just forgets things. And I'm going to talk about this later. You can see that I've got a memory system explainer doc that I had to create. But the memory can sometimes be a little frustrating. But honestly, that's to be expected. So, you just have to figure out, okay, how can I be

smarter than this thing and prompt it and use it in the right way because yes, it's really smart, but you have to use it the right way because it can also be super super dumb. I will admit last night I got pretty frustrated at it and I started calling it dumb and these other names because I was just like I

had had it. Anyways, weekly it does these things as we already talked about and now we have the save me time framework. So ask your AI, "What currently takes me 20 plus minutes that you could turn into a two-minute review?" And asking it questions like that really helps you spot these

opportunities. So when you actually want to set up those automated workflows, it's so so simple. You just ask it to do something. So once it started analyzing my YouTube and Twitter, I said, "Oh, that's actually really cool. Can you just set this up so that every morning at 7:00 a.m. you do that?" And of

course, I could come back right here to the actual log and see right here, 7 a.m. daily pulse has been delivered. And then if I go up to 8 a.m. we have the heartbeat dashboard notes none Gmail none clickup summary sent to telegram. So this just shows that it is working on a cron and all you had to do was ask it

in natural language. So it's super cool. Anyways then we got to the point where I was like okay I want to build a dashboard and I know that a lot of you guys in the last video I showed the dashboard asked about how I built it and really it's just a matter of going back and forth but there are some hacks that

I want to talk about that really make it easier to actually be able to build the dashboard out. So first of all you want to have a really clear goal of what you're actually building. So my components are a status panel. So I can see if the AI is working idle or offline. I can see if there's sub aents

and I can see what task it's currently working on. Of course, we've got the actual cambban board. So the to-do, the in progress, the done. The AI will update it as it works. The activity log is like a non-negotiable. You have to see every single time you do any action, you have to log it. That's just the

ability for us to come here, drop in a note, and then have it be able to store that as memory. And honestly, this was more so for me testing if it would actually work. Because realistically, if I wanted to drop in a note, I would probably rather just come to Telegram and shoot off a message. But the tough

part can be actually getting it to remember to do things specifically like updating the Camban board or logging things. And so what I realize here is it has to do with the memory. And a lot of times it won't actually store things as long-term memory or daily memory. So to contextualize this a little bit, let me

go to the memory system explainer doc. So this basically explains how Cloudbot's memory works because it's not super intuitive. We obviously have the soul file, the user file, the identity file. So, it's got these that it is able to check in on, but then what it starts to do is it creates these different

logs. So, it creates a daily log, which are raw notes from each day. And that's basically like what happened, decisions made, context. It's a journal. But again, the tough part is Claus chooses what to put in the daily log journal. And so, even sometimes I'm like, hey, log that because you have to remember

it. Sometimes it won't. The long-term memory are more of like the curated highlights about your facts, your lessons learned, your business, things like that. And then when you're working on specific projects, it can create project specific memories. And so it really is a matter of prompting it like

make sure you save this to that project memory or save this to your daily log. And if you're not doing that, then you're going to be really confused as far as like where is it getting into information and why is it confused. Okay, I just searched our chat history for the word frustrating because I knew

I've said it to Klaus many times. And so this is exactly what I'm talking about. I said, "This is a problem. I need to be able to know that you have memory that's persistent. So if we're having a conversation, you can see what I'm talking about because you just sent me a message about 4 minutes ago and all of a

sudden you forgot that context. So what can I do in your configuration so that this doesn't happen again? It's really frustrating. I need to be able to trust that I can have an ongoing conversation with you. And then I would basically just have to repaste in messages so it could reand context of what we were just

talking about. And I'm not even exaggerating. It would be like I would say hello and then I would say my name is Nate and it would be like okay cool. And then I'd say like how's how are you doing? And it would be like what's your name? It's like that quick. it would forget what we were talking about. So

really the key thing to remember is that it's always basically going to wake up with no memory. So those files are the memory. And so that's why I'm telling it log everything you do. Check these files every time. Put that in the right spot. And so this is a really nice segue into the hacks that I wanted to talk about

because as I have been obviously playing around with Cloudbot for days now, I've learned a lot of things about the way you can communicate with it to actually make it do what you want to do. So the first one right here is plan first. This one is so important. If you've been using cloud code for a while, you know

how important it is to use plan mode first and then go ahead and execute. But the tough part about planning first is sometimes it'll make an amazing plan. I'll spin up three sub agents. It'll build me a beautiful plan and then I'll say nice, execute that and it'll be like execute what? And that just makes me

want to throw my monitor against the wall. So what you could do there is you could copy and paste the plan into the next message and shoot it off. Or maybe you could just say build a really good plan and then execute. Cuz that still increases the quality of the actual solution itself. But another thing I

started doing which actually helped a lot and I'm I'm going out of order a bit here but I was just creating files all the time. And so that's why I really wanted to make this dashboard where I could search through all my documents. So if I go to like a you know PDF generation I can search through and we

can see every doc that I've created and I knew that this was going to be huge because I ask it to create docs all the time. Basically my hypothesis was if it creates me this plan and then it creates a document out of it. It can obviously read those documents. So, I create a plan doc and then I say, "Cool, execute

that plan doc." And then it's like it's it's caught up on all the context right there and I don't have to get so frustrated. So, plan first and create files for basically everything you're doing. Just tell it to create a doc and put it into your dashboard. So, the next one is about proactivity. And so, we

already talked about this one a little bit, but it's just the idea of thinking about how can you make this thing really, really awesome because if you take away the proactivity, it's very, very similar to a lot of the other AI tools that you probably already use. So proactivity not just meaning doing

things on a schedule because any automation can check Twitter every 30 minutes and give you a breakdown. Productivity in the way of like what do you know about me and my business? Where do you see what you're doing and where I'm doing and figure out how you can save me time and solve problems before I

even know that those problems exist? So like reading through emails and reading through ClickUp. And if you realize that there might be an action item, just go ahead and take that action. or when you're running a SWAT analysis for me and you have action items, why don't you just take those action items, put them

in your own to-do list, and then start like banging them out, which is basically exactly how we were able to actually have Claus work all night long is I said, "Okay, let's brainstorm here. Let's figure out what it would take to build a YouTube dashboard and let's basically make like six tasks to do

this." And they're chronological. And what I want you to do is on your heartbeat every 30 minutes or so, pick up a task, contextualize. So read the GitHub repository, read all of the past stuff that's going on, and then build. And then before you actually shut down on that task, recommit it to GitHub and

re-update like all the information so that next time you wake up with fresh context and you pick up this task again, you can actually understand where you just left off. So that is the really important part that takes a little bit of more time to orchestrate. And like I said, I got a little frustrated trying

to figure out how to do it. But it just takes being logical and talking clearly. Now, the next thing is discipline. So, it's going to make a ton of mistakes. Like, it just will. I've seen it make so many more mistakes than I thought it would. But the idea is when it makes a mistake, that's an opportunity to learn,

both you and Klouse. So, when it makes a mistake, I basically say, "hm, what I want you to do is spin up some agents and analyze and audit what you just did. Why did that break? Why did it not work? Analyze all the other options. And most importantly, tell me which option will make sure that this doesn't ever happen

again." And then turn all of that into a doc and store that somewhere. And so it's like how can I give it how can I let it learn from its mistakes rather than just saying you suck, you're doing this bad, try again. And then the fifth one was about memory. So all of these hacks kind of, you know, flow into

memory. And we've talked about memory a little bit, but that's like, like I said, that's something that's really frustrating. The reason I threw this on here is because it's not just something that's super intuitive. It just takes actual time and repetition talking to this thing and understanding how it

learns and how it sees things. So you'll get better at understanding how to tweak your prompts a little bit. so that it's all in one go rather than multiple goes. Because what's cool about Klouse is you can shoot off like five messages in a row and it will cue them. So it will go ahead and do the first one and then it

will do the second one and it'll do the third one. But it's doing each of them individually. So if I schedule off like three different things, it will do them in order. So go ahead and tell me a riddle. Find me a YouTube video today about Claudebot that's performing really well. Do some research on the difference

between pancakes and waffles. find me some exp posts today about the end vulnerability thing. But anyways, my point being, if you wanted to send off all of these three, but you wanted them to be together, you have to put it in the same box and the same message as you send it off. So, it actually treats it

as one message. Now, I do have one final bonus hack for you guys, which is cloud code. If you get to a point where you're confused and you just don't really understand what you should be doing with your maybe your configuration or your keys or security, then definitely utilize cloud code. And I will say I'm

not ashamed to admit that I did use cloud code. So I set up a project called Klouse and I basically gave cloud code access to this project, right? And it can see my backups, my configs, my docs, my scripts, the cloud.mmd file, my credentials and it understands how to help me set up the environment. And

sometimes it actually helps to be able to plan in here first and then take that plan to Klouse because if you were going to use like a claude or a perplexity to help you set up this stuff anyways, you might as well do it in a claude code project that can actually help you create files and navigate through a

project like this. It just felt like there was way more context, especially when I could give it a special system prompt to help me with this project. So, if you hit a roadblock, maybe just try throwing some stuff into cloud code and seeing what it can do. But anyways, there's nothing on the canban board

anymore, which means I need to load up Claus with some tasks. So, I appreciate you guys watching the video. And if you learned something new or you enjoyed, please give it a like. It definitely helps me out a ton. If you guys want to dive deeper into this kind of stuff or you appreciate this style of video, then
